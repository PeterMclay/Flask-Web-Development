	      <h3>The Project</h3>
	      <p> The Tessaract Power Co. uses a potent new power source that comes in the form of cube-like tessaracts.These appear at the edge of the power plant and must be placed within a Power Pyramid
	          that converts the energy of the tesseract into electricity. Your task is to design and build an autonomous mechatronic device that can collect a tesseract, and place it into a Power Pyramid. The power plant floor is square, with the length of each side in the range of 6â€“10 feet. A number of Power Conduits lie on the floor and must be manoeuvred over. Tessaracts can appear anywhere along the wall edge, which is approximately 3.5 inches high. The base of the Power Pyramid is approximately 4 inches square and it stands 3 inches tall. It has a 1.5 inch square opening in the base to accommodate a tessaract. The Power Pyramid must be lifted and placed over the tessaract. Due to the nature of the power conversion process, the Power Pyramid moves throughout the power plant. To assist in localizing the Power Pyramid, it emits a modulated infrared signal. The carrier frequency is 38 kHz and sends out streams of single ASCII characters that can be decoded. While the power plant will always be roughly square, the device should be robust to changes in the room geometry and the placement of Power Conduits. The Pyramid Power Pack location on the wall will be random, as will be the location of the Power Pyramid.

	        <h3> The Design </h3>
	        <p> We started from scratch, building the robot, selecting components to use, writing code in C++, 3D printing and machining parts, and finally putting it all together to construct the final product. The process starts with detecting the tesseract; I developed a searching algorithm which allowed the robot to navigate around the perimeter of the arena with the use of ultrasonic sensors. Once the tesseract is detected on-top of the wall, a servo motor swings an arm to magnetically collect the tesseract. IR sensors are then used alongside another searching program to identify the Power Pyramid. The robot continuously searches for the power pyramid until the correct frequency is detected, it then drives forward until a limit switch at the front of the robot hits the pyramid. A 3D printed forklift is used to lift the Power Pyramid up, the tesseract is detached from the arm using another servo motor and slides down a ramp underneath the Pyramid. The forklift then drops the pyramid and backs away, effectively completing the goal of the project.</p>
